<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This is a movie I put off for so long because I thought it gloried violence, until I actually watched it and realised it wasn't anything like that.</p>
<h3>Se7en</h3>
<p>I love the tension in this movie, the story of the antagonist and find it thought provoking.</p>
<h3>The Green Book</h3>
<p>A movie my husband chose for us to watch, I hadn't heard of it before.  Viggo Mortenson was spectacular in the movie, I think he's a world class actor.</p>
